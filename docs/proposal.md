## Summary
Our project will be a downhill navigation AI for Minecraft. Our scenario will begin with the agent at the top of a tall structure. The goal will be to navigate down the structure to the bottom successfully, with taking minimal fall damage.

## AI/ML Algorithms
Q-learning, the AI will follow and update a policy based on its progressive successes and failures. Taking fall damage will constitute a minor failure, dying will be considered a major failure, and progressing farther than previous records will be considered a success.

## Evaluation Plan
A successful project will be able to safely climb down the entire sturcture taking minimum damage. The metrics for success will be, in order of priority: Survival, then taking minimal fall damage. We will visualize the algorithm with a grid based map of the structure with a gradient representation of depth, and the AIs progress down it. If time permits, we would love to train the agent to find the fastest route down the structure while taking minimal damage. 

## Appointment
Our appointment is on Friday, April 26 at 10:30 am.
